    <h1>A Walk to Remember</h1>

<main>
    <p>When we talk about favourite movies, I cannot help but think about this one. A story about a Pastor's daughter who falls in love with a bad boy. Or, should we say a bad boy falls in love with a churchgirl. Plot twist, this girl has a terminal illness. Despite this illness, the boy still pursues her and wins her over by naming a star after her because he knew that she liked stargazing. At the end of the story, the two get married but the girl sadly passes away.</p>
